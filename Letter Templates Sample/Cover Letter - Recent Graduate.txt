Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: {{job_profile.title}} APPLICATION.

Based on the criteria you listed, I believe I am an excellent candidate for the position of {{job_profile.title}}.  Please accept the enclosed resume as my application for the position.

I would welcome this opportunity and assure you that this would be time well spent. In advance, I thank you for your consideration and look forward to meeting with you in the near future.
