Dear Sir/Madam,

If your firm is seeking a professional who has demonstrated sound business judgement, decisiveness, well-developed planning, analytical, and communication skills, and a consistently high level of performance in a variety of progressively responsible and challenging assignments, please see my enclosed resume.

I am accustomed to a fast-paced environment where deadlines are a priority and handling multiple jobs simultaneously is a requirement. I enjoy a challenge and work hard to attain my goals. Constant communication with all levels of management has strengthened my interpersonal skills.

I will contact you next week to inquire about the possibility of an interview. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me at {{user_profile.email}}.

Sincerely,
{{user_profile.first_name}} {{user_profile.last_name}}.
